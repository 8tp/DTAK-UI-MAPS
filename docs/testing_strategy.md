# Testing & Quality Strategy

## Testing Goals
- Guarantee mission-critical capabilities (offline map access, mesh sync, TAK interoperability, chat delivery) remain reliable under adverse conditions.
- Catch regressions early through automated pipelines and targeted exploratory testing.
- Provide telemetry and diagnostics to support rapid triage.

## Coverage Matrix
| Area | Key Scenarios | Tickets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline Maps | Region download success/failure, pause/resume, cache eviction, search accuracy, CoT marker placement, drawing precision | OM-1 – OM-9, OM-11 |
| Tile Pipeline | Tile checksum validation, S3 versioning, CDN invalidation, access control | OM-10 – OM-11 |
| Mesh Networking | Peer discovery, message dedupe, delivery receipts, offline replay | P2-1 – P2-3 |
| Ditto Integration | React Native bridge stability, schema alignment, error propagation | P2-4 |
| TAK Sync | Auth lifecycle, delta sync, attachment transfer, conflict resolution | TS-1 – TS-3 |
| Chat & Mission Data | Room and DM messaging, attachment upload offline/online, resend workflow, push notifications, mission sync recovery | CH-1 – CH-5, TP-1 – TP-4 |
| Onboarding | Permission prompts order, profile persistence, initial region download | OB-1 – OB-3 |

## Automation Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Business logic, data transformations, dedupe utilities, and offline state reducers.
- **Integration Tests:** Mesh ↔ TAK synchronization paths, tile download workers, chat + mission data interactions.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate offline/online transitions on device/emulator; validate onboarding, mission workflows, and chat delivery across peers.
- **Performance Tests:** Measure tile download throughput, mesh sync latency, TAK round-trip time, and push notification delays.

## Tooling & Environments
- **CI/CD Integration:** Run unit/integration suites on every merge; nightly e2e runs with network condition simulations.
- **Test Data Management:** Maintain fixtures for tiles, missions, and chat transcripts; anonymize sensitive mission data.
- **Observability Hooks:** Capture logs/metrics for download status, mesh events, and TAK transactions to aid validation.

## Defect Management
- Record issues with ticket references and reproduction steps, highlighting environment and network state.
- Prioritize fixes impacting offline reliability, security, or mission-critical flows.
- After resolution, add regression tests and update documentation if behavior changes.

## Collaboration
- Partner with DevOps to provision Ditto/TAK staging environments and S3 buckets.
- Engage Security for penetration testing and credential audits.
- Coordinate with UX on usability testing for drawing, onboarding, and delivery status surfaces.
