# Expo Package

This bundle gathers everything needed to run the DTAK onboarding demo with Expo:

- `expo-dtak-register/`: full Expo project copied from `expo-dtak-register` (sans `node_modules`).
- `mission-screens/`: standalone React/React Native screens that inspired the Expo app, plus supporting mock assets.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd Expo_Package/expo-dtak-register
npm install
npm start
```

Launch the Expo dev server, then open the app on iOS, Android, or web.
