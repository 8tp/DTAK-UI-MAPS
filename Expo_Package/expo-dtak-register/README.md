# DTAK Register – Expo Starter

This folder contains a minimal Expo app that embeds the high‑fidelity registration flow.

Run locally (requires Node + Expo CLI):

1. cd `expo-dtak-register`
2. npm install
3. npx expo start

Notes
- Images in the in‑app reference strip are placeholders to keep this portable without bundling external PNGs. Your wireframes live in `MVP - Onboarding, Map/`.
- Camera and location are simulated; you can later replace with `react-native-vision-camera` and `react-native-permissions` per DTAK_Improved_System_Prompt_V2.md.
